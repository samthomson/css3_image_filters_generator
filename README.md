Single page angular app to generate CSS3 image filters CSS rules for a picture based on styling in GUI.


Now in CSS3 images can be styled with 'filters', Cool!

But without booting up Photoshop and playing around, how do you know exactly what filters to apply? Without constantly switching between editor and browser?

Use this tool, to choosen a pic (via URL), then slide filters and use the generated CSS rules. Easy!
